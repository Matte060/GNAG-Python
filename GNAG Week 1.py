WELCOME TO GNAG CODING!

Syntax
A computer's punctuation.
If the coding language is the language the computer speaks, syntax is it's punctuation!
It helps the computer separate different parts of our code. Just like how periods help us tell sentences apart.
There are lots of different kinds of syntax and we'll be covering it throughout the course.

Luckily Python (our language of choice makes it pretty easy), so let's get into it.

Comments!
We use comments to tell people what our code does!
Think of these like the computer's inner thoughts
'''

# Ex:
# This code adds 75 to 14
print(14 + 75)
# 89

# We add comments with the '#' symbol often called the "Hashtag" or "Pound" symbol

'''
if we want to add multiple lines of comments we use 3 ' symbols in a row.
 




Look I'm still commenting all the way down here! 
If we want to end our comment we add 3 more ' symbols.

When we are coding, we use things called functions (We'll get to those soon).
Those functions are built-in pieces of information which tell the computer to do certain actions.
Functions will have purple encoding.
'''
#Ex:
print()

'''
Functions often require pieces of additional information.
We add that additional information in the brackets associated with the function.
Each function requires unique information we'll talk about what each function needs later.

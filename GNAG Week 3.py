GNAG Computer Science Week 3!

The Input Function!
This is where the real coding begins!
The input function acts as the ears for the computer.
It allows the computer to ask the user a question.
It saves that answer as character
We can use a variable to save that information.
'''

# Ex:
# This code asks the user their favourite sport
# First we want to make sure we save the answer as a variable so we can use it later
favSport = input("What's your favourite sport?: ")

#The computer will then prompt them to submit an answer.
#After they've submitted their answer, we're going to create a personalized response!
print("You're favourite sport is", favSport, "mine is soccer!")


'''
Activity:
Create a program which asks someone a question and then provides a personalized response!
It can ask them their favourite number, sport, food, whatever you like.
Once you're done ask your neighbour or Matteo to try it out, then help your neighbours with their work.

Math!
There are 4 Basic Operators in Python:

1. Addition: we can use this operator with the '+' symbol
2. Subtraction: Used with the '-' symbol
3. Multiplication: Used with the '*' symbol
4. Division: Used with the '/' symbol
'''

# Ex 2:
# This code asks the user for their two favourite numbers, and then adds them together
favNum = input("Whats your favourite number?: ")
favNum2 = input("What's your second favourite number?: ")
print("Wow!, your favourite number is plus your second favourite number is:", favNum + favNum2)

'''
Activity: Create a Subway Order Machine!
It should ask someone:
1. how long their sub should be
2. What kind of meat should be on it
3. What toppings they want on it
4. What drink they want

After asking the customer those questions it should repeat back their order
Make sure to have comments so people understand your code
